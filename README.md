# Highlights
* The Astetics
* Interaction
* Movement 

#Notes
*Both team members put in extensive work learning a number of new platforms and programs, Unity was new to both of us so we put a week into getting experienced in that and C# which neither of us had experience in. For level and object design we practiced Gimp and Blender by reading documentation and following tutorials so we could use these programs efficiently and effectively.
*There was a lot of trouble with merging this project with each persons seperate work so many commits had to discarded
