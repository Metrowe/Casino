# Summary
A Casino, built in unity with a number of well-known games of chance. The player can walk around the casino floor with a first-person view. Games can be played by walking into a spotlight in front of the game and following the on-screen prompt. Slots is a true wildcard while roulette can be more methodical in nature. If you win big at any of the games you can spend your winnings at the prize counter, but be careful of the interesting physics that results if you take more than you can handle. If you find yourself down on your luck a few chips might be found on the ground after going completely bankrupt.

# Highlights
* In Slots the slot wheels have some clever calculations to ensure thrilling suspense while waiting for the result to be revealed with pinpoint accurate turning.
* In Roulette chips could be stacked sky high, if bets weren't efficiently broken down into the most compact stack possible. Also, the formatting of how bets are processed from initial click on a bet node all the way to calculating winnings is quite a sleek process.
* The Roulette wheel detection of the roulette ball is extremely accurate and took a lot of fine tuning to achieve.
* The prizes from the prize counter has dynamic interaction depending on the situation its encountered in.

# Notes
* Both team members put in extensive work learning a number of new platforms and programs, Unity was new to both of us so we put a week into getting experienced in that and C# which neither of us had experience in. For level and object design we practiced Gimp and Blender by reading documentation and following tutorials so we could use these programs efficiently and effectively.
* There was a lot of trouble with merging this project with each personâ€™s separate work so many commits had to discarded. A lot of file transfers were made manually then committed from Metrowe's Account, also most of the initial work was done together from one computer when fine tuning character view, movement and game interaction.
